    <p> Pop music is one of the flourishing generes of today. The modern world is fascinated by the different styles and general vibe of the music. Pop sets itself apart from other genres because it appeals to a larger audience and even incorporates a multitude of other genres within Pop. Pop music is encapsulated by singers such as <ins>Dua Lipa</ins>, <ins>Taylor Swift</ins>, and even <ins>Olivia Rodrigo</ins>. Each of these artists fall into multiple genres but pop is the most well-known. </p>

        Circling back to popular artists in the Pop genre would also be singers like Sabrina Carpenter. Sabrina has been known for her hit role on <em>Girl Meets World</em>. Sabrina also rose to fame recently on <strong>Tik Tok</strong> because of her humor and recent relationship with Barry Keoghan. Sabrina Carpenter is a well-known popstar, she sings songs like <em>Please, Please, Please</em> and other hits which have made her a <ins>superstar</ins>.
